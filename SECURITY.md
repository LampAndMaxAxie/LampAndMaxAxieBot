# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have a found a security vulnerability that either:
1. Puts all projects importing a certain dependency at risk, or
2. Puts specifically users of our project at risk

Then please follow this reporting procedure. 

At first, DO NOT blast the vulnerability/exploit in any public channels or forums. This can give attackers a notice to pounce and harm users.

Please document the vulnerability, detailing which dependency, file/lines of code, or component are at-risk or exposed to the vulnerability.
Please write a short paragraph detailing what the vulnerability is, how it works, and what is at risk.

Send that report via email to lampandmaxaxiebot@gmail.com and also direct message MaikeruKonare#1043 and Maxbrand99#5913 on Discord if possible.

We will respond ASAP to prepare a patch (if applicable) and notify our users in an appropriate way to take action updating/pulling the fix.
After you have given us a reasonable notice of at least 3 business days or the fix has already been released so the threat is past, you may discuss publicly.

Thank you for helping us keep the Axie Infinity community safe!
